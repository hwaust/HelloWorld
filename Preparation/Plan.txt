* PhD Thesis Writing
-----------------------------
The main tasks are listed as follows:

+ Task 1: Integrite all my previous work as the main body of the thesis.
           The main previous work inclues Partial Tree (with the Prefix-Based
           Indexing as an extension), BFS-Array Implementation and DPS on BaseX.

+ Task 2: Extent the current work (ADBIS submission) with more expriments.
          This part will be done in parallel throughout the whole thesis
          writing, because it will be a process of improvements. As for the
          content, I plan focus on the following aspects:
          - Investigate Hybrid Partitioning
          - Use more data sets, such as DBLP, Treebank and UniProt:SwissProt
            with more queries.

+ Task 3: Collect related work according to the main body and write the
           Introduction chapters that server the main body. This would be the
           most difficult part.

+ Task 4: Fill the rest parts of the thesis.
           Including abstract, acknowledgements, conclusion, etc.

+ Task 5: Revise and complete the thesis.

+ Other:  Handle some unkown issues. For example, filling out some documents.
