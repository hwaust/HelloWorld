# The information of this Thesis

* Title

I have to proposals:
Title 1:
A Study on Efficient Parallel Processing of XPath queries through
a novel tree strcutre with its efficient implementation or Modern
XQuery processors

Title 2:
A Study on Efficient Parallel Processing of XPath queries over
Large XML documents.
