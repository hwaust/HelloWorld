Well, the structure of your thesis will be different than mine, but I think
# first of all, provide high *quality images and graphs*
# Second, try to write it asif the reader has no idea about your field So it

  of thesis and so on but generally it's ok

publications and work of the author (listed according to the state in time of
writing the thesis):
