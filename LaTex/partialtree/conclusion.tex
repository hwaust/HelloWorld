\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we proposed algorithms for a subset of 
XPath queries on a large XML tree in parallel and 
implemented them on a 16-node PC cluster. 
We developed our own framework for the experiments. The 
experiment results showed a speedup of a factor of 6 on a 16-node PC cluster.
